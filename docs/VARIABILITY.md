# Variability Defaults

## Summary
Default limits of agreement (LoA) are starting placeholders and must be reviewed against
local lab performance. Values below are LoA half-widths (paired measurements) in mmol/L.

## Defaults table

| Context | Method | LoA half-width | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Analytic repeatability | Central lab (indirect ISE) | 2.8 | Deep Research summary (placeholder) |
| Analytic repeatability | i-STAT (direct ISE) | 2.2 | Deep Research summary (placeholder) |
| Sequential draws | Central lab (indirect ISE) | 5.8 | Deep Research summary (placeholder) |
| Sequential draws | i-STAT (direct ISE) | 5.8 | Deep Research summary (placeholder) |

## Notes
- These defaults are placeholders and should be replaced with institution-specific
  validation data.
- LoA half-widths convert to per-measurement σ via: σ = LoA / (1.96 × √2).
