- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Build a static GitHub Pages app (docs/) that computes uncertainty-aware ﾎ年a from two sodium values with method selection, context toggle, analytic CI, visualizations, and editable defaults; unit tests for core Python.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Client-side only; Python via Pyodide/PyScript; no PHI; minimal deps; normal/independent errors; LoA default conversion; no physiologic priors.
  - Follow authority order docs/SPEC.md then docs/VARIABILITY.md + data defaults; create missing docs as needed.
- Key decisions:
  - Use lightweight canvas plotting (no external chart libs).
  - Mirror `src/sodium_uncertainty` into `docs/` for Pyodide imports.
  - Interpret analytic-repeatability ﾎ年a as identically 0.
- State:
  - Core model, defaults, tests, and docs UI scaffolding created.
  - Pytest error reported: TypeError for `str | Path | None` in `defaults.py` indicates Python <3.10 in venv.
  - `python3.11` not found; system `python3` is 3.9.6; brew is available.
  - Installed Python 3.11 via Homebrew, recreated `.venv`, installed pytest, and tests now pass.
  - Full dev toolchain installed into `.venv` (ruff, pre-commit, ipykernel, jupyter, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pyarrow); initial pip run timed out then completed.
  - Ran pytest (10 passed). Ruff found 8 issues, then auto-fixed and manually wrapped one long line; ruff now passes.
  - `pre-commit install` with repo-local cache failed due to permission writing `.git/hooks/pre-commit`; confirmed `touch .git/hooks/pre-commit` fails (Operation not permitted).
  - Repo-local `.cache/pre-commit` created for pre-commit HOME and contains log.
  - User reran `PRE_COMMIT_HOME=.cache/pre-commit .venv/bin/pre-commit install`; hook now present at `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.
  - Added `.cache/` to `.gitignore`.
  - README updated with project description, local run instructions, and GitHub Pages hosting steps.
  - Added plot x-axis ticks/labels and shaded 50/95/99% intervals in distribution canvases; app now returns interval data from `docs/app.py`.
  - Implemented same-sample null p-value for analytic repeatability, updated plots to show measurement-specific distributions and observed ﾎ年a under null.
  - Added assumptions disclaimer in Results panel (independence, Normal errors, no bias/artefacts).
  - Increased x-axis tick density and added numeric CI bound labels on plots.
- Done:
  - Read root instructions in `agents.md`.
  - Checked repo structure (no existing app code or docs).
  - Added core model package, defaults JSON, tests, and docs UI.
  - Attempted `pytest` (not available in environment).
  - Installed Python 3.11 (Homebrew), recreated `.venv`, ran pytest successfully.
  - Ran pytest/ruff/pre-commit per request; pytest passed, ruff fixed and now clean; pre-commit install failed due to `.git/hooks` write permissions.
  - User successfully installed pre-commit hook.
  - Updated `.gitignore` to ignore `.cache/`.
  - Rewrote `README.md` with project overview and usage instructions.
  - Updated `docs/app.py` to compute 50/95/99% intervals.
  - Updated `docs/index.html` to draw x-axis scales and confidence bands on plots.
  - Added `same_sample_p_value` to core model and tests.
  - Updated `docs/app.py` to return same-sample p-value and measurement-specific curves/intervals.
  - Updated `docs/index.html` to show same-sample probability, hide sequential-only stats in analytic mode, and draw observed ﾎ年a line.
  - Updated `docs/SPEC.md` and `docs/DECISIONS.md` to reflect analytic null behavior.
  - Added assumptions disclaimer text in `docs/index.html`.
  - Updated plot tick density and added CI bound labels in `docs/index.html`.
- Now:
  - Report plot tick/CI label updates.
- Next:
  - None pending unless new tasks requested.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - UNCONFIRMED: None.
