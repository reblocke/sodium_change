- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Build a static GitHub Pages app (docs/) that computes uncertainty-aware ΔNa from two sodium values with method selection, context toggle, analytic CI, visualizations, and editable defaults; unit tests for core Python.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Client-side only; Python via Pyodide/PyScript; no PHI; minimal deps; normal/independent errors; LoA default conversion; no physiologic priors.
  - Follow authority order docs/SPEC.md then docs/VARIABILITY.md + data defaults; create missing docs as needed.
- Key decisions:
  - Use lightweight canvas plotting (no external chart libs).
  - Mirror `src/sodium_uncertainty` into `docs/` for Pyodide imports.
  - Interpret analytic-repeatability ΔNa as identically 0.
- State:
  - Core model, defaults, tests, and docs UI scaffolding created.
- Done:
  - Read root instructions in `agents.md`.
  - Checked repo structure (no existing app code or docs).
  - Added core model package, defaults JSON, tests, and docs UI.
  - Attempted `pytest` (not available in environment).
- Now:
  - Review implementation for completeness; tests pending environment with pytest.
- Next:
  - Run `pytest` in an environment with pytest available.
  - Provide user walkthrough and next steps.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - UNCONFIRMED: None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - `http://CONTINUITY.md`
  - `src/sodium_uncertainty/model.py`
  - `src/sodium_uncertainty/defaults.py`
  - `docs/index.html`
  - `docs/app.py`
  - `docs/SPEC.md`
  - `tests/test_model.py`
